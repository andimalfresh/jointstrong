            The JointStrong® program consists of three levels of care to ensure
            that you are given the care that you need. The best place to start
            the JointStrong® program is through our JointStrong® App. The
            JointStrong® App will take you through an assessment process to
            diagnose your condition and assist you in deciding which level of
            JointStrong® care for the treatment of your condition.
          </p>
          <p>
            For those with simple conditions, the JointStrong® app will provide
            you with specific movements designed to help you alleviate your
            back, neck, or joint pain. For those with more complex conditions or
            if you would like to talk to a licensed clinician, you will be
            directed to connect with a Jointstrong clinician through our
            national clinical network or virtual care platform.
